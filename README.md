# pysimfcs
Python simulation and analysis tools for fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and flavors thereof.

This tool was inspired by SimFCS--the long standing software package developed by Enrico Gratton at the LFD (https://www.lfd.uci.edu).  The codebase attempts to reproduce the ImageJ/Fiji plugins in my Jay_Plugins package but with python code and where possible utilizing numpy and scipy libraries.

This is a work in progress so expect bugs and changes for a while.
